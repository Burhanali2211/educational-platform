# Getting Started with Next.js 14: A Comprehensive Guide

Next.js has evolved significantly with version 14, introducing powerful features that enhance developer experience and application performance. In this guide, we'll explore how to set up a Next.js 14 project and leverage its key capabilities.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides a structure and features for creating full-stack web applications. It simplifies many aspects of modern web development, including:

- **Server-side rendering (SSR)** and **static site generation (SSG)**
- **File-based routing**
- **API routes**
- **Built-in CSS and Sass support**
- **Image optimization**
- **And much more**

## Setting Up a New Next.js 14 Project

Getting started with Next.js 14 is straightforward. You'll need Node.js 18.17 or later installed on your machine.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

During setup, you'll be prompted with several options:

```
Would you like to use TypeScript? Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes
Would you like to use the `src/` directory? Yes
Would you like to use App Router? Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias? No
```

## Understanding the App Router

Next.js 14 uses the App Router by default, which is based on React Server Components. This new paradigm offers several advantages:

1. **Server Components**: Render on the server with zero JavaScript sent to the client
2. **Layouts**: Share UI between routes while preserving state
3. **Streaming**: Progressively send UI from the server
4. **Data Fetching**: Simplified data fetching with async/await in components

## Creating Your First Page

With the App Router, pages are defined using the `page.js` (or `page.tsx`) file within a folder structure that maps to the URL path.

```jsx
// src/app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Welcome to Next.js 14!</h1>
      <p>Get started by editing this page.</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Server Components vs. Client Components

In Next.js 14, components are Server Components by default. To make a component a Client Component, add the `"use client"` directive at the top of the file:

```jsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Data Fetching

Next.js 14 simplifies data fetching within components:

```jsx
// src/app/users/page.tsx
async function getUsers() {
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch users');
  return res.json();
}

export default async function UsersPage() {
  const users = await getUsers();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Users</h1>
      <ul>
        {users.map((user) => (
          <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 represents a significant step forward in React-based web development. The App Router, Server Components, and streamlined data fetching make it easier than ever to build performant, SEO-friendly applications.

In future tutorials, we'll dive deeper into advanced features like:

- Creating API routes
- Authentication and authorization
- Database integration
- Deployment strategies
